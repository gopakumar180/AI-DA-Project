Project Overview:
The project aims to analyze the correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global stock market. Utilizing Python and various data analysis techniques, the team will explore the relationship between the spread of the virus, confirmed cases, deaths, and fluctuations in stock prices across different industries.

Objectives:

Data Gathering: Fetch and process daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths globally, aggregating the data to a global level for analysis.
Stock Selection: Choose two stocks each from distinct industries (IT, Travel, Real Estate, and Precious Metals) for further examination.
Market Data Integration: Retrieve daily high and low prices of the selected stocks using the AlphaVantage API and integrate this information with the COVID-19 dataset.
Data Visualization: Develop informative visualizations that illustrate the impact of COVID-19 on stock prices, focusing on the selected year (2022), highlighting trends, anomalies, and comparisons. Also, create a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 20 countries by confirmed COVID-19 cases for a specific date.
Project Steps:

Git Repository Setup: Establish a Git repository for collaborative development and version control.
Data Collection: Fetch daily confirmed cases and deaths data from specified URLs and create pandas DataFrames.
Data Aggregation: Aggregate the data to summarize global daily confirmed cases and deaths across countries.
Global Statistics: Generate a DataFrame displaying total confirmed cases and deaths for all countries on any given date.
Regional Analysis: Extract and analyze COVID-19 statistics specifically for Saskatchewan.
Stock Selection: Research and select two stocks from different sectors for subsequent analysis.
Market Data Retrieval: Utilize AlphaVantage API to obtain daily high and low prices for the selected stocks.
Data Integration: Append the stock market data to the aggregated COVID-19 DataFrame.
Visualization Creation:
Year 2022 Stock Analysis: Craft graphical representations illustrating the impact of COVID-19 on selected stock prices for the year 2022. Highlight significant changes and trends.
Top 20 COVID-19 Cases by Country: Create a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 20 countries based on confirmed COVID-19 cases for a specific date. Sort and colorize the bars appropriately.
Deliverables:

Git Commit Logs: Regular commits showing consistent contributions from all team members.
Python Solution Files: Upload Python (*.py) and Jupyter Notebook files to GitHub and Brightspace dropbox, ensuring individual contributions are combined into a comprehensive Notebook.
Visual Outputs: Present visually compelling and informative graphs and charts reflecting the project's analysis and findings.
This project aims to merge data analysis skills, stock market knowledge, and visualization techniques to offer insights into the interconnectedness of global health crises and financial markets.
